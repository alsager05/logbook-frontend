## 🔒 Security & Permissions

### Tutors Can:

- ✅ View institutions they've joined
- ✅ View forms in those institutions (read-only)

- ✅ Review resident submissions

### Tutors Cannot:

- ❌ Submit new forms

## 🎓 Technical Decisions

1. **Role-Based UI**: Different tabs for tutors vs residents for better UX
2. **View-Only Forms**: Disabled submission for tutors to prevent confusion
3. **Resident List**: Shows only residents with the tutor as supervisor
4. **Separate Screen**: ResidentDetailsScreen for detailed view
5. **Statistics**: Quick overview of resident's progress
6. **Query Keys**: Proper React Query keys for caching

---

## 📝 Notes

### Important Implementation Notes:

1. **Forms Tab Behavior:**

   - Tutors see forms but cannot tap to submit
   - Forms are styled to show they're view-only
   - Badge clearly indicates "View Only"

   - Filtered by institution
   - Shows submission count per resident

3. **Navigation:**
