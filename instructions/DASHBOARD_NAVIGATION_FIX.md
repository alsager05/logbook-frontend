# Dashboard Navigation Fix

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. **Settings Tab Navigation**

**Problem**: Dashboard was trying to navigate to "Settings" tab which no longer exists (replaced with "Profile" tab)

**Fixed**:

- Changed `navigation.navigate("Settings")` to `navigation.navigate("Profile")`
- Updated icon from `settings-outline` to `person-outline`
- Updated subtitle from "Account settings" to "Account & settings"
- Location: Line 223-228 in `DashboardScreen.js`

---

### 2. **FormReview Navigation from Recent Activity**

**Problem**: Direct navigation to "FormReview" from Dashboard didn't work because FormReview is nested in tab stacks

**Fixed**:

- Changed to nested navigation that first goes to appropriate tab
- For Residents: Navigate to "My Submissions" tab â†’ then "FormReview" screen
- For Tutors: Navigate to "Forms" tab â†’ then "FormReview" screen
- Location: Lines 255-276 in `DashboardScreen.js`

**Before**:

```javascript
navigation.navigate("FormReview", {
  formName: form.formTemplate?.formName || "Form",
  formId: form.formTemplate?._id,
  submissionId: form._id,
});
```

**After**:

```javascript
if (userRole.toUpperCase() === "RESIDENT") {
  navigation.navigate("My Submissions", {
    screen: "FormReview",
    params: {
      formName: form.formTemplate?.formName || "Form",
      formId: form.formTemplate?._id,
      submissionId: form._id,
    },
  });
} else {
  navigation.navigate("Forms", {
    screen: "FormReview",
    params: {
      formName: form.formTemplate?.formName || "Form",
      formId: form.formTemplate?._id,
      submissionId: form._id,
    },
  });
}
```

### 3. **View All Navigation**

**Problem**: "View All" button in Recent Activity section only navigated to "Forms", which doesn't work for residents

**Fixed**:

- Added role-based navigation
- Residents: Navigate to "My Submissions"
- Tutors: Navigate to "Forms"
- Location: Lines 237-246 in `DashboardScreen.js`

**Before**:

```javascript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={() => navigation.navigate("Forms")}>
  <Text style={themedStyles.viewAllText}>View All</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

**After**:

```javascript
<TouchableOpacity
  onPress={() =>
    navigation.navigate(
      userRole.toUpperCase() === "RESIDENT" ? "My Submissions" : "Forms"
    )
  }>
  <Text style={themedStyles.viewAllText}>View All</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```
