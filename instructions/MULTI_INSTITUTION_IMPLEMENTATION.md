## 📋 What Was Implemented

### 1. **API Service** (`api/institutions.js`)

Created a complete institutions API service with the following endpoints:

- `getAllInstitutions()` - Browse all available institutions
- `getMyInstitutions()` - Get user's joined institutions with stats
- `joinInstitution(id)` - Join/request to join an institution
- `getInstitutionById(id)` - Get institution details
- `getInstitutionForms(id)` - Get forms for specific institution
- `getInstitutionSubmissions(id)` - Get submissions for institution

### 2. **New Screens**

#### **BrowseInstitutionsScreen** (`screens/BrowseInstitutionsScreen.js`)

- Lists all available institutions
- Search functionality to filter institutions
- Shows institution details (name, code, description, contact)
- Join button with confirmation dialog
- Shows "Joined" badge for already-joined institutions
- Pull-to-refresh support
- Empty state handling

#### **MyInstitutionsScreen** (`screens/MyInstitutionsScreen.js`)

- Displays all institutions the user has joined
- Shows statistics (forms count, submissions count)
- "Join More" button in header
- Empty state with guidance to browse institutions
- Pull-to-refresh support
- Tap on institution to view its forms

#### **InstitutionFormsScreen** (`screens/InstitutionFormsScreen.js`)

- Tap on form to submit
- Tap on submission to review
- Pull-to-refresh support
- Empty states for both tabs

### 3. **Updated Existing Screens**

#### **FormScreen** (`screens/FormScreen.js`)

- Now accepts `institutionId` and `institutionName` from navigation params
- Displays institution badge when submitting to an institution
- Includes `institutionId` in submission data
- Shows institution-specific success message

#### **ResidentSubmissionsScreen** (`screens/ResidentSubmissionsScreen.js`)

- Added institution badges to submission cards
- Shows institution name for each submission
- Better card header layout to accommodate institution info

### 4. **Navigation** (`App.js`)

- Added new "Institutions" tab with business icon
- Tab is available for both residents and tutors
- Stack navigator includes:
  - MyInstitutions (default screen)
  - BrowseInstitutions
  - InstitutionForms
  - Form (for submitting institution forms)
  - FormReview (for reviewing submissions)

## 🔌 Backend Integration

The implementation expects the following backend endpoints:

### Required Endpoints

1. **GET** `/institutions` - Get all active institutions

   - Response: Array of institution objects

2. **GET** `/institutions/me` - Get user's institutions

   - Response: Array of institutions with stats
   - Stats include: `formsCount`, `submissionsCount`

3. **POST** `/institutions/:id/join` - Join institution

   - Response: Success message with institution details

4. **GET** `/institutions/:id` - Get institution details

   - Response: Institution object

5. **GET** `/formTemplates?institutionId=xxx` - Get institution forms

   - Response: Array of form templates

6. **POST** `/formSubmitions` - Create submission

   - Body should include: `institutionId`
   - Response: Created submission object

7. **GET** `/formSubmitions?institutionId=xxx&formPlatform=mobile` - Get submissions
   - Response: Array of submissions

### Expected Data Structures

#### Institution Object

```json
{
  "_id": "inst_id",
  "name": "Hospital Name",
  "code": "H001",
  "description": "Description text",
  "logo": "url/to/logo.png",
  "contactEmail": "contact@hospital.com",
  "isActive": true,
  "formsCount": 12,
  "submissionsCount": 45
}
```

#### Submission with Institution

```json
{
  "_id": "submission_id",
  "formTemplate": {...},
  "institution": {
    "_id": "inst_id",
    "name": "Hospital Name"
  },
  "resident": {...},
  "tutor": {...},
  "status": "pending",
  "submissionDate": "2025-01-15"
}
```

## 📝 Usage Notes

### For Developers

1. **Institution Context**: When navigating to FormScreen from InstitutionFormsScreen, always pass `institutionId` and `institutionName` in route params.

2. **API Integration**: Ensure backend endpoints return data in the expected format. The app handles both `response.data` and direct `response` formats.

3. **Query Keys**: Institution data uses React Query with the following keys:

   - `["allInstitutions"]` - All institutions
   - `["myInstitutions"]` - User's institutions
   - `["institutionForms", institutionId]` - Institution forms
   - `["institutionSubmissions", institutionId]` - Institution submissions

4. **Navigation**: Use `navigation.navigate()` to move between institution screens:
   ```javascript
   navigation.navigate("InstitutionForms", {
     institutionId: institution._id,
     institutionName: institution.name,
     institutionLogo: institution.logo,
   });
   ```

### For Users

1. Navigate to the "Institutions" tab
2. If you have no institutions, tap "Browse Institutions"
3. Search or scroll to find institutions
4. Tap "Join" to join an institution
5. Once joined, tap on the institution to view forms
6. Select a form to submit
7. View your submissions in the "My Submissions" tab

## 🔜 Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Institution Filters**: Filter submissions by institution on main submissions screen
2. **Institution Leave**: Allow users to leave/unjoin institutions
3. **Institution Requests**: Handle join requests that require approval
4. **Institution Stats**: More detailed analytics per institution
5. **Institution Settings**: Per-institution preferences
6. **Offline Support**: Cache institution data for offline access
7. **Institution Search**: Advanced search with filters (location, type, etc.)
8. **Institution Notifications**: Institution-specific announcements

---

## 🎓 Architecture Patterns Used

- **Service Layer**: Centralized API calls in `api/institutions.js`
- **React Query**: Data fetching, caching, and synchronization
- **Context API**: Theme management via ThemeContext
- **Stack Navigation**: Screen hierarchy and navigation
- **Tab Navigation**: Main app navigation
- **Component Composition**: Reusable styled components
- **Error Handling**: Try-catch with user-friendly error messages
- **Loading States**: Activity indicators during async operations
- **Empty States**: Guidance when no data exists

## 📞 Support

For questions or issues:

- Refer to `MOBILE_APP_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed specifications
- Check API endpoint responses match expected format
- Verify backend endpoints are properly configured
- Ensure user authentication includes institution data
